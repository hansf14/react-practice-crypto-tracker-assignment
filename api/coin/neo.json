		"ko": "네오는 중국에서 최초로 만들어진 블록체인 프로젝트로, 스마트 자산 플랫폼(smart assets platform)으로 기능합니다. 이 플랫폼은 네오의 독립적인 스마트 컨트랙트 기술인 '네오컨트랙트'를 기반으로 하며, 이들은 이더리움처럼 네오 버츄얼 머신(VM)위에서 실행됩니다. 이 외에도 DBFT, NeoX, NeoQS와 같은 독자적인 기술을 구현합니다.\r\n\r\n현재 50%의 네오는 크라우드 펀딩을 통해 배포되었고, 나머지 50%는 NEO 위원회에서 관리한다고 합니다. 위원회에서 관리하는 코인들은 구체적인 계획들을 따라 네오 프로젝트를 지원하는 데에 쓰일 것으로 예상됩니다. \r\n\r\n이전에 앤트쉐어(Antshares)로 불렸던 이 코인은 2017년 7월, 네오로 이름을 바꿨습니다. \r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 네오는 DBFT(delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance)를 컨센서스 메커니즘으로 사용합니다. DBFT는 보다 안전한 블록체인 플랫폼을 구현하기 위해, 노드를 운영하는 북키퍼(bookkeeper)와 블록체인 사용자로 네트워크 참가자를 분리합니다. 전문화된 북키퍼들은 사용자들에 의해 선출되고, 검증마다 이들 중 랜덤으로 블록 생성자가 결정됩니다. 그리고 만약 2/3의 북키퍼들이 검증에 동의하면 컨센서스가 체결됩니다. 이렇게 블록체인 사용 주체를 오롯이 분리해 접근하는 것은 기존 컨센서스 메커니즘에 없던 독특한 방식입니다. \r\n\r\n2. 네오 플랫폼은 네오와 네오가스라는 두 가지의 토큰을 가지고 있습니다. 이더리움과 마찬가지로, 네오가스는 플랫폼에 대한 이용료를 지급하는 데에 쓰이며 지급된 가스는 네트워크를 관리하는 북키퍼들에게 경제적 인센티브로 돌아갑니다.\r\n\r\n3. 양자 컴퓨터는 블록체인 시스템을 무력화시킬 수 있다는 우려가 있습니다. 이에 네오는 NeoQS(QuantumSafe)라는 격자구조의 암호구조를 통해 양자 컴퓨터에 대응할 수 있는 알고리즘을 갖추고 있다고 합니다. \r\n\r\n4. NeoX는 크로스 체인 상호 운영을 지원하는 프로토콜로, 이를 통해 atomic asset swap을 달성할 수 있습니다. 또한, 다른 체인에서 실행되는 스마트 컨트랙트의 일관성을 유지할 수 있습니다. \r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 중국시장, 대중적인 컴퓨터 언어 지원)\r\n\r\n1. 중국시장: 14억 인구의 시장인 중국에서 시작된 첫 블록체인 기술이기에 중국 시장에서의 선전을 기대할 수 있습니다. 또한, 중국인들이 서양의 소프트웨어보다 알리바바, 바이두, 텐센트(QQ)와 같은 자신들의 것을 비교적 선호한다는 점에서 잠재력이 큽니다. \r\n\r\n2. 대중적인 컴퓨터 언어 지원: 네오는 C#, Java, Go과 같은 다양한 언어를 지원하고 있고, 앞으로 C, C ++, Python, JavaScript까지 확장할 예정이라고 합니다.
